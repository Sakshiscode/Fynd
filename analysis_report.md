| We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food and we enjoyed some well made pub grub. Service was friendly, quality cocktails were served, and the atmosphere is derived from an old Uno's, which certainly works for a sports bar. It being located in a somewhat commercial area, I can see why it's empty so late on a Friday. From what my friends tell me - this is a great spot for happy hour, and it stays relatively busy thru 10pm. |              4 |                   |               |

| My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |              1 |                   |               |

| After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.                                                                                                                                                             |                |                   |               |

| We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!                                                                                                                                                                                            |                |                   |               |

| I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.
